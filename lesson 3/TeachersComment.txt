Well done!

3.b
v2 is better, but can be done without a subquery.
You can use ORDER BY as a last row after all UNIONed queries. In this case it would be treated as a ORDER BY of the last query and will work.

3.c
Can be rewritten without a subquery. 
Why do we need it? We can just join these 2 tables and move HAVING from the subquery to the main query.
